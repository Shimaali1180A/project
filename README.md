# 🦁🐱 Lion vs Cat - Image Classification Project

This project is an image classification system that can distinguish between images of a lion and a cat. A custom machine learning model was trained using an external platform that allows easy training of image-based models. The trained model was later tested using Python.

## 🧠 Project Description

The goal of this project is to classify images into two categories: lion or cat. The process included the following steps:

1. Model Training  
   A machine learning model was trained using a dataset of lion and cat images on the external platform Teachable Machine ([https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com)). The platform automatically handled the training process and generated the model files.

2. Model Testing  
   After training, the model was tested by providing new images to check if it could correctly identify them as either a lion or a cat.

3. Python Script for Prediction  
   A Python script was developed to load the trained model and perform predictions on test images. The script takes an image as input and returns the prediction result.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Machine Learning Model (exported from external training platform)
- Python
- Image Processing Libraries (such as PIL or OpenCV)
- TensorFlow / Keras (depending on model format)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Prepare the trained model and place it in the project directory.
2. Provide test images for prediction.
3. Run the Python script to classify the image.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project was created as part of a learning experience to understand image classification using pre-trained models and Python integration. It demonstrates the basic steps of using a custom machine learning model in a real-world scenario.
